Pipecat is a framework for building voice-enabled, real-time, multimodal AI applications

Pipecat is an open source Python framework that handles the complex orchestration of AI services, network transport, audio processing, and multimodal interactions. “Multimodal” means you can use any combination of audio, video, images, and/or text in your interactions. And “real-time” means that things are happening quickly enough that it feels conversational—a “back-and-forth” with a bot, not submitting a query and waiting for results.
